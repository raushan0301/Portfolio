  "about": {
    "intro": "I'm a B.Tech Computer Engineering student at Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology (TIET), specializing in building secure and scalable web applications. I cover everything from frontend UI to backend logic and deployment, with a strong interest in Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking.",
    "approach": "My development philosophy centers on writing secure, maintainable code. I don't just build features, I architect systems with security considerations baked in from the start. Whether it's implementing role-based access control with Supabase RLS, securing authentication flows with Firebase, or designing scalable database schemas with PostgreSQL, I approach every project with both a builder's creativity and a defender’s mindset.",
    "current": "Currently, I'm deepening my expertise in full-stack development with React, Node.js, and Express, while actively practicing offensive security techniques through EC-Council CEH v13 and CND v3 Labs. This dual perspective makes me a more thoughtful and security-aware engineer."
